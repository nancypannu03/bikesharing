## Overview of the statistical analysis:
In this analysis we will be using Tableau to visualize bike-sharing data.
Resources required: 
     - 201908-citibike-tripdata csv File- We will use Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time          in hours and minutes. Then we export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the visualizations in Deliverable 2
     - Tableau Public- In Tableau Public, we will create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis.
     
### The purpose of the analysis:

Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

      How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
      How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
      A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results: There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)


### Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
### Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
#### How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
#### How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
#### A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.


## Summary:
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
